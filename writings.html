			The Green Grass All Around

			Reflection, too late, has brought me the only grief I have felt since your passing. I am disgraced by my disregard for your legacy. Years on, I look back at your image, tainted; mere shadows of your once glowing hair. I had once cherished the days I could see you anew. I had once appreciated your life, but even your calming presence could not persist beyond death. Now, I recall your body betraying you. I see your hair darkened by your fragmented form. Your skin dried and falling remembered as a sickening stick on my skin.

			But were you not the one that lay by my side as I struggled to sleep? Did you not care for your family members, both old and new? Was it not you who entertained with your joyful trot?

			To forget what you meant is to forget your life. As you laid motionless in your bed, I did not recognize your imprint on my mind. As your figure was framed by the dirt, I could not see the green grass all around.

			I can now.

			Ocean

			As the sun gets low
			I slip into the deep blue
			Covered in a soft glow
			Covered in a cold coat of you

			Under your surface
			I can't notice whipping wind
			Isolated from my fears
			And wholly part of you

			Yet still I am wary
			Of the time we spend together
			I know with or without you
			I cannot survive

			Sacred time spent in your grasp
			But gone too soon
			Emerging back into myself
			I gain what I lost
			And I still can't breathe

			Apart from you
			I feel lost
			A part of you
			I can't stay

			Though you may drift back and forth
			And we can't be as one
			I still love your embrace
			And I cherish the moments
			I see you again
