			The Green Grass All Around<br>
			<br>
			Reflection, too late, has brought me the only grief I have felt since your passing. I am disgraced by my disregard for your legacy. Years on, I look back at your image, tainted; mere shadows of your once glowing hair. I had once cherished the days I could see you anew. I had once appreciated your life, but even your calming presence could not persist beyond death. Now, I recall your body betraying you. I see your hair darkened by your fragmented form. Your skin dried and falling remembered as a sickening stick on my skin.<br>
			<br>
			But were you not the one that lay by my side as I struggled to sleep? Did you not care for your family members, both old and new? Was it not you who entertained with your joyful trot?<br>
			<br>
			To forget what you meant is to forget your life. As you laid motionless in your bed, I did not recognize your imprint on my mind. As your figure was framed by the dirt, I could not see the green grass all around.<br>
			<br>
			I can now.<br>

			Ocean<br>
			<br>
			As the sun gets low<br>
			I slip into the deep blue<br>
			Covered in a soft glow<br>
			Covered in a cold coat of you<br>
			<br>
			Under your surface<br>
			I can't notice whipping wind<br>
			Isolated from my fears<br>
			And wholly part of you<br>
			<br>
			Yet still I am wary<br>
			Of the time we spend together<br>
			I know with or without you<br>
			I cannot survive<br>
			<br>
			Sacred time spent in your grasp<br>
			But gone too soon<br>
			Emerging back into myself<br>
			I gain what I lost<br>
			And I still can't breathe<br>
			<br>
			Apart from you<br>
			I feel lost<br>
			A part of you<br>
			I can't stay<br>
			<br>
			Though you may drift back and forth<br>
			And we can't be as one<br>
			I still love your embrace<br>
			And I cherish the moments<br>
			I see you again<br>
